		<h2>In 2+ sentences, describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p>I am trained as a pastry chef and have worked as a cheesemonger but have always been curious about programming and building websites.</p>

		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>I would like to be able to build an interactive website and maybe even an iPhone app some day.</p>

		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>I have taken CSCI E-50a and E-50b (Introduction to Computer Science Using Java) but that was a few years ago, so I feel a little rusty. More recently, I have taken some less intensive classes online that gave me a very basic introduction to building a website: "Creating Web Pages," "Introduction to CSS3 and HTML5" and "Introduction to Dreamweaver CS5." Writing in HTML and CSS is still new for me so I took a look back at my online class coursework and referenced the W3 website to create this page.</p>

		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>I am working on an iMac with OS X Version 10.9.4.</p>

		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
		<p>Nope!</p>
